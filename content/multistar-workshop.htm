						Dirk Hovy is a Full Professor in the Computing Sciences Department of Bocconi University, and the scientific director of the Data and Marketing Insights research unit. Previously, he was faculty at the University of Copenhagen, got a PhD from USC’s Information Sciences Institute, and a linguistics master’s in Germany. He is interested in the interaction between language, society, and machine learning, or what language can tell us about society, and what computers can tell us about language. He is also interested in ethical questions of bias and algorithmic fairness in machine learning. He has authored over 100 articles on these topics, including 3 best paper awards, and two textbooks on NLP in Python. Dirk has co-founded and organized several workshops (on computational social science, and ethics in NLP), and was a local organizer for the EMNLP 2017 conference. He was awarded an ERC Starting Grant project 2020 for research on demographic bias in NLP.

					Large Language Models have made impressive contributions to NLP. We can now translate, summarize, and generate text at human and super-human levels. So, are we done with NLP? In this talk, I will look at some of the (sizable) remaining pockets of unresolved questions and issues, even in high-resource languages like English. It turns out that there is still plenty to do with language of and for children and non-standard speakers, the safety and harmlessness of models, and the application to non-standard tasks. I will suggest some aspects that can make for interesting future directions and enjoyable puzzling to make NLP fairer and (even) more performative.

					With the increase of digitized data and extensive access to it, the task of extracting relevant information with respect to a given query has become crucial. The variety of applications of the tasks related to Information Extraction, together with the impossibility of annotating data for every individual setup, require models to be robust to data shifts. In this talk I will present the findings of my PhD project with respect to one of the most important challenges of Information Extraction: The ability of models to perform in unseen scenarios (i.e., unknown text domains and unknown queries). Specifically, I will dive deep into the challenges of cross-domain Relation Extraction.

						Rob van der Goot's main interest is in low-resource setups in natural language processing, which could be in a variety of dimensions: including language(-variety), domain, or task. He did his PhD on the use of normalization for syntactic parsing of social media data, one specific case of a challenging transfer setup. Afterwards, he focused on using multi-task learning in challenging settings. Most recently, Rob focuses on more low-level tasks (language identification, tokenization) in challenging settings (cross-lingual, cross-domain, for low-resource languages/scripts) where performance of large language models is inadequate.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					 This talk will consist of three parts, aligned to the focus of Rob's research in 3 parts of his career. 1. Lexical normalization and its downstream effect on syntactic tasks: ranging from benchmark creation to SOTA lexical normalization and finally the usefullness of normalization 2. Multi-task learning for adaptation in challenging setups. I will cover several studies in a variety of setups that aim to shed some light on the beneficiality of auxiliary tasks 3. Back to the basics: can language models solve tasks like word segmentation and language identification, or are there better approaches? what are the remaining challenges for these tasks?

					We have a pressing technological need for systems that can efficiently extract occupational skills for the broader job market. This demand is particularly heightened in the era of Industry 4.0 (Heiner et al., 2015) and the emergence of cutting-edge large language models (Zarifhonarvar, 2023). It is necessary that we swiftly adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of qualifications. In this presentation, I will introduce two contributions where we have created open-source datasets and language models specifically designed to enhance Natural Language Processing for Human Resources applications, with a focus on both English and Danish. Lastly, I will briefly delve into the challenges we face when harnessing these large language models to address the demands of the labor market.

					Italy is one of the most linguistically-diverse countries in Europe: besides Standard Italian, a large number of local languages, their dialects, and regional varieties of Italian are spoken across the country. The natural language processing (NLP) community has recently begun to include language varieties of Italy in its repertoire; however, most work implicitly assumes that language varieties of Italy are interchangeable with each other and with standardized languages in terms of language functions and technological needs. In this talk, I will discuss the main challenges of the default NLP approach when dealing with such varieties, presenting opportunities for locally-meaningful work and alternative directions for NLP in under-explored areas of research.

				</p>
				<p>
					Despite the recent success of Natural Language Processing (NLP), driven by advances in large language models (LLMs), there are many challenges ahead to make NLP more human-facing and inclusive. For instance, low-resource languages, non-standard data and dialects pose particular challenges, due to the high variability in language paired with low availability of data. Moreover,  while language varies along many dimensions, evaluation today largely focuses data assumed to be  `flawless'. In this talk I will survey some of the challenges, and outline potential solutions, discussing work on  NLP for dialects and data-centric NLP, which includes learning in light of human label variation.

					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to make meaningful advancements in NLP, it is crucial that we maintain a keen awareness of the limitations inherent in the evaluation metrics we employ. We evaluate the robustness of metrics to non-standardized dialects, i.e., their ability to handle spelling differences in language varieties lacking standardized orthography. To explore this, we compiled a dataset of human translations and human judgments for automatic machine translations from English into two Swiss German dialects. Our findings indicate that current metrics struggle to reliably evaluate Swiss German text generation outputs, particularly at the segment level. We propose initial design adaptations aimed at enhancing robustness when dealing with non-standardized dialects, although there remains much room for further improvement.

						David Sasu is currently a Computer Science PhD candidate at IT University of Copenhagen with the NLPNorth Research Group and also a Student Researcher in Machine Learning Research at Apple. For his PhD research, he is focused on how suprasegmental speech information like prosody can be applied to improve spoken language understanding and other Natural Language Processing tasks for low resource languages, with a particular interest in African Languages. He graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Ashesi University and also has a Master’s Degree in Computer Science from IT University of Copenhagen.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Spoken Language Understanding for low-resource languages is still relatively under-developed, since for most of these under-represented languages, the computational models for performing common spoken language understanding tasks do not exist. This is primarily due to the fact that the requisite forms of data needed for the construction of such models are either non-existent or extremely difficult to obtain. However, even if the data needed for the creation of Spoken Language Understanding systems for low-resource languages could be made readily available, these systems are typically designed using only textual information hence ignoring all of the rich information that is present within the corresponding audio representations of the textual data which may be useful in improving the performance of these systems since most of these low-resource languages, especially African Languages, are tonal in nature. This talk would explore how speech prosodic information could be extracted and applied to play a key role improving spoken language understanding systems for these languages.

						Joakim Nivre is Professor of Computational Linguistics at Uppsala University and Senior Researcher at RISE (Research Institutes of Sweden). He holds a Ph.D. in General Linguistics from the University of Gothenburg and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Växjö University. His research focuses on data-driven methods for natural language processing, in particular for morphosyntactic and semantic analysis. He is one of the main developers of the transition-based approach to syntactic dependency parsing, described in his 2006 book Inductive Dependency Parsing and implemented in the widely used MaltParser system, and one of the founders of the Universal Dependencies project, which aims to develop cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation for many languages and currently involves over 140 languages and over 500 researchers around the world. He has produced over 300 scientific publications and has over 22,000 citations according to Google Scholar (May, 2023). He is a fellow of the Association for Computational Linguistics and was the president of the association in 2017.

					Universal Dependencies (UD) is a project developing cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation for many languages, with the goal of facilitating multilingual parser development, cross-lingual learning, and parsing research from a language typology perspective. Since UD was launched almost ten years ago, it has grown into a large community effort involving over 500 researchers around the world, together producing treebanks for 141 languages and enabling new research directions in both NLP and  linguistics. In this talk, I will briefly review the history and development of UD and discuss challenges that we need to face when bringing UD into the future.

						Jörg Tiedemann is professor of language technology at the Department of Digital Humanities at the University of Helsinki. He received his PhD in computational linguistics for work on bitext alignment and machine translation from Uppsala University before moving to the University of Groningen for 5 years of post-doctoral research on question answering and information extraction. His main research interests are connected with massively multilingual data sets and data-driven natural language processing and he currently runs an ERC-funded project on representation learning and natural language understanding.

					In our group, we focus on the development of language technology that covers a large range of linguistic diversity. Our main focus is currently on the development of neural translation models and multilingual representations that can be learned from massively parallel data sets. In my talk, I will briefly introduce the OPUS eco-system with its resources and tools that we provide to the research community. Lesser resouced languages are particularly interesting as modern data-driven NLP faces difficult challenges when training resources are scarce. There are exciting areas of knowledge transfer and multiingual NLP that enable progress in this area. I will briefly mention work we do in our group.

						Max Müller-Eberstein is a PhD Fellow at the IT University of Copenhagen’s NLPNorth group as well as MaiNLP Lab at LMU Munich, both under the supervision of Barbara Plank, and co-supervised by Rob van der Goot. His research explores structured subspaces in self-supervised latent representations in order to identify hard to quantify overlaps between modalities. These alignments have been applied to improving structured prediction in low-resource scenarios as well as to make visual art more accessible by mapping them to musical patterns.

					Languages across the globe exhibit an incredible amount of diversity, yet also naturally share certain characteristics. Language models, by approximating distributions over large corpora of multi-lingual texts, learn latent spaces which allow us to compare distributional shifts across languages. This in turn enables data-driven, cross-lingual analyses of what our languages share and to which degree. In this talk, we explore how to measure these similarities using weakly-supervised methods, subspace probing and spectral frequency analysis. These methods allow us to uncover surprising cross-lingual overlaps, which help identify suitable languages for transfer learning in specialized low-resource scenarios.
