				<h3>Barbara Plank<span style="font-weight: normal;">: Welcome and Introduction</span></h3>
				<p style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .6;">
					13:30 – 13:40
				</p>

				<h3>Sebastian Ruder<span style="font-weight: normal;">: Challenges and Opportunities in Multilingual Evaluation</span></h3>
				<p style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .6;">
					13:45 – 14:15
				</p>
				<p>
					As NLP systems become increasingly multilingual, we are presented with the challenge of how to effectively evaluate them across many languages. In this talk, I will discuss some of the challenges in multilingual evaluation, including creating benchmarks that accurately assess performance in different languages as well as designing evaluation setups and metrics that are not biased towards a particular language. I will provide examples to illustrate these challenges and finally discuss potential solutions.

				<h3>Daniel Hershcovich<span style="font-weight: normal;">: Challenges and Strategies in Cross-Cultural NLP</span></h3>
				<p style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .6;">
					14:20 – 14:50
				</p>
				<p>
					Various efforts in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community have been made to accommodate linguistic diversity and serve speakers of many different languages. However, it is important to acknowledge that speakers and the content they produce and require, vary not just by language, but also by culture. Although language and culture are tightly linked, there are important differences. Analogous to cross-lingual and multilingual NLP, cross-cultural and multicultural NLP considers these differences in order to better serve users of NLP systems. We propose a principled framework to frame these efforts, and survey existing and potential strategies.

				<h3>Rob van der Goot<span style="font-weight: normal;">: Sem-mmmBERT: Multi-task Learning with a Predefined set of Tasks and no Tuning</span></h3>
				<p style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .6;">
					15:15 – 15:45
				</p>
				<p>
					Previous work on multi-task learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP) often
					incorporated carefully selected tasks as well as carefully tuning of
					architectures to share information across tasks. Recently, it has been shown that
					for autoregressive language models, a second pre-training step on a wide variety of
					NLP tasks leads to a set of parameters that more easily adapt for other NLP
					tasks. In this paper, we examine whether a similar setup can be used in
					autoencoder language models using a restricted set of semantically oriented NLP
					tasks, namely all SemEval 2022 tasks that are annotated at the word, sentence
					or paragraph level. We first evaluate a multi-task model trained on all SemEval
					2022 task that concern word or sentence annotation (7 tasks, 11 sub-tasks), and
					then evaluate whether re-finetuning the resulting model for each task
					specificially leads to further improvements. Our results show that our
					mono-task baseline, our multi-task model and our re-finetuned multi-task model
					each outperform the other models for a subset of the tasks. Overall, huge gains
					can be observed by doing multi-task learning: for three tasks we observe an error reduction of more than 40%.

				<h3>Isabelle Augenstein<span style="font-weight: normal;">: Determining the Credibility of Science Communication</span></h3>
				<p style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .6;">
					15:50 – 16:20
				</p>
				<p>
					Most work on scholarly document processing assumes that the information processed is trustworthy and factually correct. However, this is not always the case. There are two core challenges, which should be addressed: 1) ensuring that scientific publications are credible -- e.g. that claims are not made without supporting evidence, and that all relevant supporting evidence is provided; and 2) that scientific findings are not misrepresented, distorted or outright misreported when communicated by journalists or the general public. I will present some first steps towards addressing these problems and outline remaining challenges.
